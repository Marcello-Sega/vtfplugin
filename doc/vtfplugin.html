<h1>VMD trajectory/structure/coordinate format plugin</h1>

The plugin reads files written in the 
<a
href="http://github.com/olenz/vtfplugin/wiki/VTF-format">
VMD
trajectory/structure/coordinate format</a>. The format was designed
specifically for VMD and is useful for hand-written simulation codes and
coarse-grained simulations. It is currently used by the <a
href="http://espressomd.org/">ESPResSo</a> coarse-grained
simulation package.

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>
<b>Read-only</b>
<br>This plugin is used only to read files. VMD does not currently support
writing this file type.
